# cliif

A simple and efficient file system interface. 

Move across directories, create files and directories, and read and write files with a simple and intuitive interface.

## Usage

The app will open up on your home directory. You can move around only using the arrow keys.

### Moving around

- `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to move up and down the list of files and directories.
- `Left` to move up a directory.
- `Right` to move into a directory.
- `Enter` to open a file.
- `Space` to open the current directory

<!-- TODO ### Creating files and directories -->

## File Associations

You can associate file extensions and applications.

<!-- TODO: Setup config file. For now modify file_associations.dart -->

<!-- For example, you can associate `.py` files with `python3` and `.md` files with `vim`. To do so, create a file called `.cliifrc` in your home directory and add the following lines:

```
.py python3
.md vim
``` -->
