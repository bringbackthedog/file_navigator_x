## File Associations

You can associate file extensions and applications.

<!-- TODO: Setup config file. For now modify file_associations.dart -->

<!-- For example, you can associate `.py` files with `python3` and `.md` files with `vim`. To do so, create a file called `.fnxrc` in your home directory and add the following lines:

```
.py python3
.md vim
``` -->
